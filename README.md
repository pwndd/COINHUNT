# Coinhunt
A fake "wallet miner" made by me in python.

# How to run the script
On a linux system, do the following:
```git clone https://github.com/pwndd/COINHUNT && cd COINHUNT && pip install colorama termcolor psutil```

# How the script works
It first prints out a bunch of junk, including ascii art (~fancy~). Then, it "tests" a server and prints out some random IP and ping results. Then, the program prompts you to input how many wallets to go through. The program will start.

# False Positives
The program will create another file, named "results.txt". This file will contain the final "right" wallet and a fake BTC ammount. THIS MAY TRIP YOUR ANTIVIRUS! The file is completely safe and tested. You can see the VirusTotal results here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dce128416a288e05b8424f505849daa2826df619805f98047985cab1509919b3

# Scammer Warning
People on TikTok, or any other major platform could try and sell people this script for money. If you do see this happening, please report it to me ASAP. This program is free to use!
